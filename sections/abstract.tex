\begin{abstract}
	Your abstract here. This is a dummy text to demonstrate the problem.
	To solve the issue of text overflowing the page width, ensure that
	the text is properly wrapped and that there are no excessively long 
	words without spaces. Additionally, consider splitting the text into
	multiple lines or paragraphs if necessary. This is a new line of the
	abstract, which should automatically wrap according to the page width.
	Further text is added to ensure that wrapping behavior is tested thoroughly.
